Choose a .csv dataset file, then choose two columns as the X and Y axis.

### Run Algorithm
Click 'Step' for one iteration of recalculating centroid positions and clusters.

Click 'Finish' to perform iterations until centroids are relatively stable.
This will also open a new window showing data about each cluster.
You can also select a cluster from the table to highlight it on the main graph.
